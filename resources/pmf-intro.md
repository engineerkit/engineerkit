**Product Market Fit (PMF) definition** - The degree to which a product or service satisfies a strong market demand.

**The core indicator that a business's product has reached PMF** - When a business has built a scalable and sustainable business model through providing value to a customer segment's needs.

**The initial steps a business takes to approach the "chasm" and read PMF** (thoughts from "The Four Steps to the Epiphany" by Steven Blank):
- **Customer Discovery** - Has a solution to market problem been matched?
- **Customer Validation** - Has the solution been sold five times in a repeatable way?
- **Customer Creation** - Has sufficient demand been created and put in the sales funnel?
- **Company Creation** - Has the organization successfully shifted from discovery to execution?

**Quote from Steven Blank** - "If customer discovery and validation [initial PMF] have failed to uncover a solution to a need that at least 5 customers will pay for in a repeatable way, why would you turn your efforts to scaling demand, where there is none, and moving the company away from learning and discovery, when it clearly still needs to do just that? **Further execution on the same failed plan guarantees disaster**"
